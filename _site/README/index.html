<p>Start a local server</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a foler <code>/admin</code> at the site root with a file <code>index.html</code>. It is <code>src/admin</code> in this repo</li>
<li>make a media folder for uploads. In the config it is <code>media_folder</code> -- where in the repo they are saved. <code>public_folder</code> is the path relative to site root</li>
</ul>
<h3>authentication</h3>
<p>Registration is <strong>open</strong> for testing.</p>
<p>Go to Settings &gt; Identity, and select Enable Identity service.</p>
<p>With the backend set to handle authentication, now you need a frontend interface to connect to it. The open source Netlify Identity Widget is a drop-in widget made for just this purpose.</p>
<p>Add the netlify ID widget to <code>/index.html</code> and also <code>/admin/index.html</code></p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Also add a <code>script</code> tag to the body of <code>/index.html</code>:

<h3>identity</h3>
<p>The localhost site redirects to <code>whammyanalog</code> after logging in, but the live site goes to the right place</p>
<p>Need to delete the localStorage thing:
https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1704</p>
<pre><code>localStorage.removeItem(&quot;netlifySiteURL&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>netlify cli</h2>
<p>https://cli.netlify.com/netlify-dev#usage</p>
<hr>
<p>Whammy just has a <code>template</code> tag in the html that is used by vanilla JS to render the products at run-time. The is no generating a static site, just runtime JS &amp; html files.</p>
<p>This site will be re-built every time an edit is made via the CMS.</p>
<p>Need a way to pull in the data that is saved by CMS</p>
<hr>
<p>https://dev.to/koabrook/creating-a-basic-blog-with-eleventy-and-netlify-cms-completely-from-scratch-197e</p>
<p>Create a new folder in the project's root and name it _includes. This folder will contain templates that our blog will use to render pages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The addPassthroughCopy lines tell Eleventy to include those folders and their contents in the generated site.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any element that should appear on every single page should reside in base.njk. Let's add the following to the file</p>
